# CTU_LinkedList
Linked List from scratch. This project required me to to create a custom Linked List. 
This also displays understanding of file-io and reading from a CSV. 

Some of the requirements were: 
1)	it was from scratch, without using the prebuilt LinkedList class provided by Java.
2)	It had to read from the given file, a Comma Separated Value file, and parse the data correctly.
3)	It has to be sortable by insertion sort (I know, I know, why would you ever do that to a Linked List. The idea was to make sure we understood the way OO worked, as well as the way insertion sort works). I just sorted by name but it could easily be changed to sort by whatever argument given. 
4)	It also needed to have a function for displaying just the names of those in the list.
